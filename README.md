I'm using this project as a way to experiment with and learn F#. I started with the FSharp [ProjectScaffold](http://fsprojects.github.io/ProjectScaffold/index.html).
Custom plugins can be created that implement the IPlugin interface. These plugins will be run and their output posted to Slack using Slack's incoming webhooks.
